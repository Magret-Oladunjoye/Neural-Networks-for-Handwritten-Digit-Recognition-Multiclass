# Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Multiclass
A simple Neural network to perform handwritten digit recognition for the digits 0-9.

For the tensorflow model implementation, I used Keras Sequential model and Dense Layer with a ReLU activation to construct a three layer network. 

A Softmax activation function was then applied to the predictions gotten from the model to perform probability estimation for the digits
